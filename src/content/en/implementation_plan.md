Implementation plan
===================

Development should be started by creating the platform. Only after that,
we will be able to work on the implementation of specific features.


Phase 1. Development of the platform
------------------------------------

*	Collection of the development team
*	Addressing key issues on architecture
*	Addressing issues on licensing
*	Partition of the project into modules and division of developers
into teams
*	Studying of existing proprietary products
*	Studying of existing free/libre products
*	Addressing issue on authorship of the code
*	Business planning
*	Organization of the work of developers:
	*	Building systems
	*	Testing
	*	CI-servers
	*	Binary artifacts repository
	*	Modules repository
	*	Management of agile development
	*	Bug tracker
*	Determining needs in third-party libraries and inclusion of them
into our building system
*	Implementation of the platform:
	*	Engine for modules a-la OSGi (under permissive license)
	*	Thin client for desktop platforms
	*	Application server (including TS compiler)
	*	DBMS
	*	DB schemes
	*	Installers
*	Writing documentation
*	Implementation of some simple methods of data analysis (for tests)
*	Performance testing


Phase 2. Filling with base features
-----------------------------------

*	Development of standard interfaces
*	Studying of specialized literature and scientific publications
*	Studying of the opinions of traders and scientific community
*	Taking into account opinions and needs of developers themselves
*	Detailed studying of features of existing proprietary products
*	Detailed studying of existing free/libre products with a view to
reuse existing code
*	Inclusion of third-party libraries into our building system
*	Calling in additional developers
*	Implementation of connections to data providers and trade organizers
*	Implementation of features in the form of separate modules
*	Comparison of different implementations by performance, choosing of
the best solutions
*	Writing documentation
*	Porting to other platforms
*	Development of web-application
*	Development of thin clients for mobile platforms
*	Professional recast of logo, design of website and so on
*	Registration of trademark
*	Usability testing
*	Monetization
*	Promotion of the product:
	*	Advertising
	*	Presentation at the conferences of various orientations
	*	Promotion via exchanges, brokers and dealing centers
	*	Implementation of robots and participation in competitions
*	Certification of the product on security and compliance to standards


Phase 3. Support and growth
---------------------------

*	Fixing of detected bugs
*	Quality paid support
*	Implementation of more exotic features not implemented at phase 2
*	Porting to other platforms
