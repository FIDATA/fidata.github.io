About name
==========

When I started this project, I had to choose a good name for it.
Previous attempt had its own name. Nevertheless, it had turned out that
there had existed a commercial product with the same name. Therefore, to
avoid confusion and legal issues, I chose new name: FIDATA.

**Why FIDATA?**

Italian word '<span lang="it">fidata</span>' is feminine adjective that
means 'trusted'. Cognate words in English include 'fidelity'.

In the world of finance, trust is never in excess. You can't do business
with somebody unless you trust him. In finance world, too many actors try
to make some money using foul play. Financial software isn't in
exception. People avoid black boxes since only God knows what they
really do with their money. Choosing a software for their purposes,
users want to believe that it is sincere, well made and has no
significant bugs (although there is still no warranties). I hope that
one day FIDATA will deserve trust of its users.

'FIDATA' can be considered as acronym for '<span lang="en">FInancial
Data Analysis and Trading Application</span>',
'<span lang="en">FInancial DATA</span>', '<span lang="en">Financial
Instruments DATA</span>' and, possibly, many other expansions (If you
know good, interesting or comical ones, please,
[let me know](<%= @items["/#{@item[:lang]}/contacts/"].path %>)).

The recommended pronunciation is the same as Italian
'<span lang="it">fidata</span>':
[<span lang="it-fonipa">fi-dá-ta</span>]. Some people (at least in
Russia, where I'm from) would say: as it is written, so it is
pronounced.

I like this name, and I have no interest to discuss changing of it
without rational reasons.
