FAQ
===

*	**I know existing product that meets all your
[requirements](<%= @items["/#{@item[:lang]}/requirements/"].path %>).
Why you develop a new one?**

	If you know such product, please,
[let us know](<%= @items["/#{@item[:lang]}/contacts/"].path %>).

*	**I propose to make the product under non-free license.**

	Non-free product is not extensible and so doesn't meed the
[requirements](<%= @items["/#{@item[:lang]}/requirements/"].path %>).
So, this will never happen.

*	**I don't like the name of the product. I propose you another
name.**

	You have to have rational reasons to change the name. If you have
such reasons and your name is as good as
[our](<%= @items["/#{@item[:lang]}/name/"].path %>), then
[contact us](<%= @items["/#{@item[:lang]}/contacts/"].path %>).

*	**I think that project needs domain in .com zone.**

	If you want to sell us [fidata.com](http://fidata.com/),
[contact us](<%= @items["/#{@item[:lang]}/contacts/"].path %>).
If you offer us to change the name of the product then forget it.
