Monetization
============

Personally, for me the interest is in final product that I could use for
development of trading strategies making money from the exchange.

Reasons of inevitability of monetization:

*	One of the
[requirements](<%= @items["/#{@item[:lang]}/requirements/"].path %>#quality_technical_support)
of the project is provision of quality technical support.
*	Not all developers are ready to work without pay or for the idea.

I see the following ways of monetization of the project:

1.	Paid support

2.	Selling of binaries

	Project is big, and building will be technically sophisticated and
will require a lot of time. Therefore, even having source code, rare
users will want to build by themselves.

	Notes:

	*	It can be difficult to combine selling of binaries and modular
install/update via Qt Installer Framework.
	*	Thin clients for mobile platforms can be sold via application
shops.

3.	Selling buildings of server under GPL instead of AGPL

	See
[Licensing](<%= @items["/#{@item[:lang]}/licensing/"].path %>).

GPL will allow users to change server's code and plug in theirs modules
not disclosing the code.

4.	Selling of databases:

	*	DB of historical quotes
	*	DB of social and economic statistics
	*	DB of metadata (financial instruments, issuers and so on)

	I am supporter of freedom of information and I don't like the idea
of selling of databases. However, creation of databases requires either
large costs of our labor or buying of information from third parties.
Maintenance of the database up to date requires constant costs. If we
won't be able to cover them by technical support then we would have no
other choice. Selling of databases would be inevitable. If we wouldn't
sell updated DBs or provide them free of charge someone else would sell
them.

	Databases of publicly accessible factual data are protected by sui
generis database right (in Russia DB with at least 10000 items is
protected).

	We can release databases in two editions:

	*	Community edition — standard free of charge version, meeting
needs of novice user.  Possibly, editing by community of users.
	*	Full edition — full paid version maintained up to date.

	Otherwise, databases can be segmented by regions, financial
instruments and so on.
