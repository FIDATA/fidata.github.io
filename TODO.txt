I've made this website in hastle. It works, but some desirable features
are still missing. Some code needs cleaning and searching for more
optimal decisions.

This document deals with code and layouts only. TODOs about website
content aren't covered here.

1.	Disqus

2.	CSS Validation

3.	Gemfile — define groups (:production, :test etc.)

4.	Add `nanoc check` into Gradle script

	+ Isolate Fonts and Logo into separate artifacts (get rid of
`static` directory entirely)

	+ Improve generation of webfonts.css via SCSS
	
5.	HTML Compresser

6.	rainpress, uglifier

7.	Compass (CSS Reset, CSS3)

8.	ImageSize
	(https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2941419)

12.	Licenses for jQuery, Mathjax
